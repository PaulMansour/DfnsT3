[ksphere] sides with the topologists so, here,⍞000Dwe call a circle a 1-sphere or S1.⍞000D⍞000DHere are the surface areas  of some unit hyperspheres.  In particular, the "sur-⍞000Dface area" of a 1-sphere (circle) is its circumference.⍞000D⍞000D    (1 to 10) ksphere 1             ⍝ surface of unit ⍺-spheres.⍞000D6.2832 12.566 19.739 26.319 31.006 33.073 32.47 29.687 25.502 20.725⍞000D⍞000DNotice that the area of a unit k-sphere achieves a maximum at  around  6 dimens-⍞000Dions. In his paper, Eugene poses the question: What dimension of space gives the⍞000Dmaximum hypervolume to the unit radius hypersphere?⍞000D⍞000DAs coded,  [ksphere] is a continuous function over real ⍺, so we can investigate⍞000Dnon-integral dimensions.

Let''s start with a familiar 2-sphere S2:⍞000D⍞000D    Take a pair of 2-balls (flat circular discs) of thin rubber sheet  and care-⍞000D    fully glue their outside (S1) edges  together.  Then  inflate  the  enclosed⍞000D    space to produce a regular 2-sphere. A Flatlander [7], living on the surface⍞000D    of S2, would  perceive  it  as  an  unbounded,  though  finite,  2-universe.⍞000D    Ferdinand Magellan  was in a similar position as he explored  his finite but⍞000D    unbounded 2-sphere.⍞000D⍞000D    Similarly,  S1  may  be  constructed by gluing the endpoints of a pair of 1-⍞000D    balls  (line segments)  together  and  bowing  the  lines outwards to form a⍞000D    circle.  A "Linelander",  travelling around the circle, would not notice the⍞000D    two joining S0 points.⍞000D⍞000D    We  "3-landers"  can build a 3-sphere by gluing the 2-sphere boundaries of a⍞000D    pair  of  "adjacent"  3-balls  (though we need to borrow a little 4-space in⍞000D    which to do the job).  To  make it easier, let''s don scuba gear and swim in-⍞000D    side one of a pair of massive 3-balls (reqular 3D balls) of sea-water, which⍞000D    are suspended close to each other in 4-space.  After our 4-lander friend has⍞000D    glued  together the outer 2-sphere-boundaries of our 3-balls  (using special⍞000D    transparent sea-water adhesive) we can swim from our home hemiball, straight⍞000D    ahead  in  any  direction,  into  the  other hemiball. If the sea-water glue⍞000D    really is transparent,  we should not notice as we swim through the 2-sphere⍞000D    join.  Again,  we''re  in an unbounded manifold:  even though we are within a⍞000D    finite volume of water, no matter how far we swim in any direction,  we will⍞000D    never encounter a boundary.⍞000D⍞000D    NB: Before using a harpoon gun, please heed the warning,  which  is  towards⍞000D    the end of the notes on →life←, about using artillery in a finite manifold.⍞000D⍞000D    The Poincaré Conjecture⍞000D    -----------------------⍞000D    Imagine a 2-dimensional (Flatland) spider wandering around in the surface of⍞000D    a large soap bubble.  To  amuse  herself in this bleak landscape she plays a⍞000D    little game:  as she moves, she extrudes a single filament of web, which is,⍞000D    of course, also embedded in the surface of  the  S2  bubble.  Her game is to⍞000D    roam around her 2-sphere looking for the starting end of the  filament  and,⍞000D    when she finds it, to reel it in.  As  she  is holding both ends of the fil-⍞000D    ament, topologically speaking, it forms a circle S1.  Our  spider finds that⍞000D    she can _always_ reel in her web-loop  and so she convinces herself that she⍞000D    must be in the surface of a sphere, rather than, for example, in the surface⍞000D    of a more exotic 2-manifold, such as a torus (S1×S1).⍞000D⍞000D    We can play the same game in our sea-water 3-sphere:  we swim forwards while⍞000D    uncoiling our wreck-diving rope,  leaving one end at a fixed position in the⍞000D    3-water.  We find that, after swimming straight ahead in any direction for a⍞000D    distance of ○2×⍵, the end of the rope hoves into view again. Now, if we grab⍞000D    both ends of the rope and start to pull,  we should be able to  reel  in the⍞000D    whole of the loop without its becoming tight.⍞000D⍞000D    By analogy with the flat-spider in the surface of torus S1×S1, we might  not⍞000D    always be able to reel in our rope had we found ourselves swimming,  for ex-⍞000D    ample inside S1×S1×S1,  which is made by gluing together opposite faces of a⍞000D    _cube_ of sea-water.⍞000D⍞000D    It has long been assumed that a 3-sphere is the only 3-manifold in which one⍞000D    can always reel in the rope-loop in this way.  This  assumption  is known as⍞000D    the "Poincaré Conjecture" and a proof of it,  which carried a million-dollar⍞000D    reward, eluded mathematicians for the whole of the  twentieth  century.  The⍞000D    conjecture was proved in 2002 by Grigori Perelman, building on work by Rich-⍞000D    ard Hamilton.
