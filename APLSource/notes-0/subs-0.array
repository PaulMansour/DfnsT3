'array ← (from repl) ##.subs array           ⍝ Vector substitution.⍞000D⍞000DThe left argument is a 2-item vector of ''find'' and ''replace'' vectors or scalars.⍞000DOccurrences  of  [from]  along  the last axis of the right argument are replaced⍞000Dwith  [repl].  When  [from] and [repl] are of differing lengths, shorter vectors⍞000Dalong the last axis are padded on the right with prototypical items.⍞000D⍞000DSubs is an alternative to →ss← and →ssmat← with the following advantages:⍞000D⍞000D- The right argument may be of any rank.⍞000D- It is a slightly quicker in many cases.⍞000D- Having the substitution pair on the left allows:⍞000D    - Composition of a substition pair to form a new monadic function.⍞000D    - Multiple substitutions using the primitive reduce operator (/).⍞000D- [from] and [repl] may be nested arrays.⍞000D⍞000DNote  that regular expressions are not used; there are no special characters, so⍞000D''*'',  ''[]'', etc. are taken literally.  Notice also that in the case of overlapp-⍞000Ding strings, both strings are identified and both are replaced.⍞000D⍞000DExamples:⍞000D⍞000D      dots←'' ·''∘subs                            ⍝ Composition.⍞000D⍞000D      dots 2 12⍴''Many a time and oft.
