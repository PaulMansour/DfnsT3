'num ← ##.osc num                            ⍝ Oscillate - probably returns 1.⍞000D⍞000DThis function expounded by L.Collatz in 1937, illustrates the "cleanness" of the⍞000DD-function style. B.Thwaites (1996) has offered a £1,100 reward for proving that⍞000Dit  terminates  for  all  ⍵>0  and Paul Erdős commented: "Mathematics is not yet⍞000Dready for such problems."⍞000D⍞000DIn "Gödel, Escher, Bach:", Douglas Hofstadter defines a natural number (n) to be⍞000D"Wondrous"  if  (osc n) terminates. He points out that no-one has yet discovered⍞000Dan "un-wondrous" number.⍞000D⍞000DThis sequence is also known as the "Hailstone" or "3N+1" sequence.⍞000D⍞000DExample:⍞000D⍞000D      osc¨⍳40               ⍝ (engineer''s proof)⍞000D1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1⍞000D⍞000DSee also: k6174 m91⍞000D⍞000DIndex:Oscillate|cash prize|wondrous number|Gödel, Escher, Bach|proof, engineer''s⍞000DIndex:Hailstone sequence|3N+1 sequence|sequence|engineers|Collatz sequence⍞000DIndex;Collatz L.|Thwaites B.|Erdős P.|Hofstadter D.'
