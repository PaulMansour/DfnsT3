'cvec ← ##.ss (srce from into)               ⍝ Approx alternative to xutils'' ss.⍞000D⍞000DThe  right  argument  is a 3-item vector of simple vectors. The result is formed⍞000Dfrom  the  source  [srce] with occurrences of string [from] replaced with string⍞000D[into].  Notice  that  regular  expressions  are  not used; there are no special⍞000Dcharacters, so ''*'', ''[]'', etc. are taken literally. Notice also that in the case⍞000Dof overlapping strings, both strings are identified and both are replaced.⍞000D⍞000DExamples:⍞000D⍞000D      ss''Banana'' ''an'' ''AN''                  ⍝ non-overlapping strings.⍞000DBANANa⍞000D⍞000D      ss''Banana'' ''ana'' ''ANA''                ⍝ overlapping strings.⍞000DBANAANA⍞000D⍞000D      ss (⍳10) (3 4 5) (88 99)              ⍝ numeric strings.⍞000D1 2 88 99 6 7 8 9 10⍞000D⍞000D      ss''b.bb'' ''bb'' ''zz''                    ⍝ "Ray''s case".⍞000Db.zz⍞000D⍞000DSee also: subs ssmat ssword subvec⍞000D⍞000DIndex:xutils, ss|string replacement|substitution'
