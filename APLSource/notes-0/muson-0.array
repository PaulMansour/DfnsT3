For⍞000Dexample:⍞000D⍞000D(muse:⍞000D·⍞000D    A muse is a compound of "musons"; the elementary particles of consciousness;⍞000D    the  atoms of our mental world.  More complex patterns, such as our views on⍞000D    politics, religion, country music, and so forth, are constructed from clust-⍞000D    ers of these units.⍞000D·⍞000D    An example of a muson might be  the fleeting intention to buy more trash-can⍞000D    liners.  In isolation, the muson is typically temporary and inconsequential;⍞000D    anything smaller does not register on EEG.⍞000D·⍞000D    The human mind is characterized by its ability  to build large and  enduring⍞000D    structures from such particles, while other animals get by with much simpler⍞000D    combinations. For a dog, memory-of-rabbit is about as fancy as it gets.⍞000D·⍞000D    Some meditation regimes may be seen as the attempt  to  dwell  for  extended⍞000D    periods within a single muson.  The most successful exponent of  this  turns⍞000D    out to be the common oyster (Ostrea edulis),  which spends its entire mental⍞000D    life within the sole muson of which it is capable.⍞000D·⍞000D    Although  there  is  no  direct  human equivalent of  the oyster''s muson, an⍞000D    approximation might be something midway between an appreciation of sea water⍞000D    and a vague yearning for locomotion.⍞000D⍞000D    But see: seme (semantics), meme (memetics) and morpheme (linguistics).⍞000D)⍞000D⍞000DIndex:muse|oyster|consciousness|seawater'
