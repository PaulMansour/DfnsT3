'rslt ← {guess←1+⎕ct} (fn ##.invr) argt      ⍝ Inverse of real-valued function.⍞000D⍞000DSuggested  by Mike Day, operator [invr] uses the Newton-Raphson method to find a⍞000D[rslt], such that:⍞000D⍞000D    argt ≡ fn rslt⍞000D⍞000Dwhere  operand [fn] is a monadic continuous real-valued function and [argt] is a⍞000Dnumeric array.⍞000D⍞000DThe  left  argument (default 1+⎕ct), is a starting point for the iteration. Some⍞000Dfunctions,  such  as  sin←1∘○,  are  "many-to-one", which means that the inverse⍞000Dcould  be  any  of  a number of values. In this case the left argument should be⍞000Dchosen to be close to the desired one. See the "ArcSin" example below.⍞000D⍞000DThe  choice  of ⎕ct as a default starting point is arbitrary. 0, 1 or ⍵ would be⍞000Djust  as good. 1+⎕ct has the small advantage that it tends to avoid the discont-⍞000Dinuity at 0, of primitive functions ⍟ and ÷.⍞000D⍞000DBugs:⍞000D⍞000DWith an unfortunate choice of starting value, [invr] may generate a "no inverse"⍞000Derror or may even fail to terminate.⍞000D⍞000DExamples:⍞000D⍞000D      ○invr ○ 2 3⍴⍳6                ⍝ inverse of primitive function pi-times.⍞000D1 2 3⍞000D4 5 6⍞000D⍞000D      {⍵+⍵}invr 2 4 6               ⍝ inverse of doubling function.⍞000D1 2 3⍞000D⍞000D      {2*⍵}invr 16                  ⍝ inverse of 2-exp is 2-log⍞000D4⍞000D      {⍵*2}invr 49                  ⍝ inverse of square is sqrt.⍞000D7⍞000D⍞000D      c2f←{32+⍵×1.8}                ⍝ define Celsius to Fahrenheit⍞000D⍞000D      f2c←c2f invr                  ⍝ derive Fahrenheit to Celsius⍞000D⍞000D      c2f (0 100) (¯40 ¯273)        ⍝ convert nested array of temperatures.⍞000D 32 212  ¯40 ¯459.4⍞000D⍞000D      f2c (32 212) (¯40 ¯459.4)     ⍝ convert using inverse function.⍞000D 0 100  ¯40 ¯273⍞000D⍞000D      sin←1∘○                       ⍝ Sin(⍵)⍞000D⍞000D      sin 10⍞000D¯0.54402⍞000D⍞000D      arcs←sin invr                 ⍝ ArcSin(⍵)⍞000D⍞000D      arcs sin 10                   ⍝ ArcSin(Sin(10)).⍞000D68.54⍞000D⍞000D      9 arcs sin 10                 ⍝ ArcSin(Sin(10)) near 9.⍞000D10⍞000D⍞000DSee also: limit pow⍞000D⍞000DIndex:function inverse|inverse|Newton-Raphson⍞000DIndex;Day M.⍞000D'
