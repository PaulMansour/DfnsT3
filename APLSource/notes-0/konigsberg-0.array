'A "planar" graph is one that may be drawn on the 2-D plane with its edges inter-⍞000Dsecting only at its vertices.⍞000D·⍞000DExamples include:⍞000D·⍞000D- A map of a country''s adjacent states or territories.⍞000D- The layout of a maze or a city street plan.⍞000D·⍞000DAn  example of the latter is the arrangement of seven bridges over a fork in the⍞000Driver  at  Königsberg  (now  Kaliningrad in Western Russia). One of the earliest⍞000Dachievements in graph theory was a proof in 1735 by Swiss mathematician Leonhard⍞000DEuler, that is it impossible to walk over each bridge exactly once.⍞000D·⍞000DHere  is  a  map  of  the  area,  together  with  a picture of the corresponding⍞000Dgraph (*) and its coding; the four areas of land adjacent to the river are cons-⍞000Didered vertices, and the bridges, edges:⍞000D·⍞000D    Map                ┐ ┌     ┐ ┌   [1]     ┐ ┌⍞000D    ---         ┌──────│ │─────│ │───────────│ │──────⍞000D                │~~~~~~│ │~~~~~│ │~~~~~~~~~~~│ │~~~~~~~⍞000D                │~~~┌──│ │─────│ │───┐~~~┌───│ │────────⍞000D                │~~~│  ┘ └     ┘ └   │~~~│   ┘ └⍞000D                │~~~│      [2]      └─────┘⍞000D                │~~~│  ┐ ┌     ┐ ┌  ┌─────┐⍞000D           ─────┘~~~└──│ │─────│ │───┘~~~│   [3]⍞000D            ~~~~~~~~~~~│ │~~~~~│ │~~~~~~~│⍞000D            ───────────│ │─────│ │───┐~~~│⍞000D                       ┘ └     ┘ └   │~~~│   ┐ ┌⍞000D                           [4]       │~~~└───│ │───────⍞000D                                     │~~~~~~~│ │~~~~~~~~⍞000D                                     └───────│ │─────────⍞000D    Graph                                    ┘ └⍞000D    -----   ┌───1───┐⍞000D            │   │   │       Coding:  (2 2 3)(1 1 3 4 4)(1 2 4)(2 2 3)⍞000D            │   │   │⍞000D            ├───2───3⍞000D            │   │   │⍞000D            │   │   │⍞000D            └───4───┘⍞000D·⍞000DEuler''s  masterstroke  was  in  considering _vertices_, rather than _edges_ when⍞000Dthinking about the problem. His proof went something along the lines of:⍞000D·⍞000DThe number of edges issuing from a vertex is called its "degree". To succeed all⍞000Dbut  the starting and finishing vertices must have an even degree (corresponding⍞000Dwith  an entry to, and exit from the vertex). This cannot be the case in Königs-⍞000Dberg, as more than two vertices have an odd degree.⍞000D·⍞000D(*) Note  that the graph above is strictly a "pseudo-" or "multi-" graph as some⍞000Dvertices  are  connected  by more than one edge. This is apparent from duplicate⍞000Ditems in the graph coding:  {~⍵≡∪¨⍵}.⍞000D·⍞000DAn example of a non-planar graph is any complete graph of size>4:⍞000D·⍞000D    {⍵∘{⍺~⍵}¨⍵}∘⍳ 5         ⍝ order ⍵ complete graph.⍞000D┌───────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬───────┐⍞000D│2 3 4 5│1 3 4 5│1 2 4 5│1 2 3 5│1 2 3 4│⍞000D└───────┴───────┴───────┴───────┴───────┘⍞000D⍞000DIndex:Königsberg|Kaliningrad|graph, planar|pseudo-graph|multi-graph⍞000DIndex;Euler L.'
