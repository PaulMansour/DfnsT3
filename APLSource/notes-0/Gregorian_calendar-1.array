'Gregorian and Julian Calendars⍞000D------------------------------⍞000DThe  time taken for the Earth to orbit the sun is approximately 365.242198 days.⍞000DThis  means that in order to avoid drifting from the solar year, a calendar must⍞000Dcorrect for the extra 0.242198 day (05:48:45.9072) each year.⍞000D⍞000DThe  Romans  attempted  to accommodate this extra time with the Julian calendar,⍞000Destablished  by  Julius Caesar in 45 BCE. The Julian calendar added an extra day⍞000Dto each fourth (leap) year, producing an approximation of 365.25 days.⍞000D⍞000DBy the sixteenth century, it became apparent that the Julian calendar was out of⍞000Dsynch with the solar year by well over a week.⍞000D⍞000DThe  Gregorian  calendar,  proposed by Neapolitan physician Aloysius Lilius, was⍞000Dintroduced  to  correct  for this error. In accordance with recommendations from⍞000Dthe  Council  of Trent (1545-1563), it was decreed by Pope Gregory XIII in papal⍞000Dbull "Inter Gravissimas" on Feb 24, 1582.⍞000D⍞000DIn most of continental Europe, the new calendar came into effect on October 4th,⍞000D1582,  with  the  removal of the following 10 days. This meant that, in Rome for⍞000Dexample, the day following October 4th was October 15th. France followed shortly⍞000Dafter, on December 9th of the same year.⍞000D⍞000DIn  Great  Britain  (UK)  however,  the  new  calendar was not adopted until the⍞000D→British_Calendar_Act_1751←, which removed 11 days September 3-13 in 1752. Diff-⍞000Derent  states  in  the US adopted the changes at different times, depending upon⍞000Dtheir allegiance to Rome, Paris or London. See →gcr←.⍞000D⍞000DAll of this means that when converting historical dates in the Julian, as oppos-⍞000Ded  to  the  modern  Gregorian  calendar, we must be careful to specify when the⍞000Dchange took place. For example, specific dates in the seventeenth century do not⍞000Drefer to the same day when quoted in French or British sources. The problem even⍞000Doccurs in adjacent states in the US! See →gcr←.⍞000D⍞000DBoth  →days←  and  →date←  take the date of the Julian to Gregorian change as an⍞000Doptional left argument. →gcr← lists arguments for various locations.⍞000D⍞000DThe Gregorian calendar approximates the solar year as 365+97÷400 = 365.2425 days⍞000Dwhich means that it takes approximately 3,300 years to shift one day relative to⍞000Dthe true solar year.⍞000D⍞000DThe approximation 356+97÷400 is achieved by an injecting an extra 97 "leap" days⍞000Devery 400 years, using the rule:⍞000D                                          Extra days / 400 years⍞000D    Each year in 400 has 365 days,  ·   ·   ·   ·   ·   ·      0⍞000D    ·   except that every 4 years is a leap year,   ·   ·   +100⍞000D    ·   ·   except that every 100 years isn''t,  ·   ·   ·     -4⍞000D    ·   ·   ·   except that every 400 years is. ·   ·   ·     +1⍞000D                                                            ----⍞000D                                                              97⍞000D                                                            ¯¯¯¯⍞000DThe rule could be extended to give ever-closer approximations to the true (corr-⍞000Dect  to  9  sig.  figs)  solar year of 365.242198 days. Astronomer John Herschel⍞000D(1792-1871), and others, proposed a closer approximation of:⍞000D⍞000D     365 + 969 ÷ 4000 → 365.24225  days.⍞000D⍞000DThis  correction would require that every 4,000 year period include only 969 ex-⍞000Dtra  days, compared with the Gregorian calendar''s 970, suggesting the additional⍞000Drule:⍞000D    ·   ·   ·   ·   except that every 4,000 years isn''t.⍞000D⍞000DTo date, no-one has implemented Herschel''s suggestion.⍞000D⍞000DSee also: mayan date days gcr⍞000DSee also: British_Calendar_Act_1751⍞000D⍞000DIndex:date|Gregorian calendar|calendar|Julian calendar⍞000DIndex;Herschel J.|Lilius A.|Boncompagni U.|Gregory XIII, Pope'
