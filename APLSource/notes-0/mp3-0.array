'{files} ← {type←''''} ##.mp3 dirs     ⍝ Create playlist(s) for music directories.⍞000D⍞000DSupplied by Veli-Matti Jantunen, who says:⍞000D⍞000DCreates  simple  playlists  in  each  directory (and each sub-directory thereof)⍞000Dspecified  by  the  right  argument.  Currently, five  playlist file formats are⍞000Dsupported  and it should be pretty simple to add new formats if needed (or fine-⍞000Dtune the specific formatter for the user''s own needs).⍞000D⍞000DThe left argument specifies:⍞000D⍞000D    lower case letters ''abmpw'' for different playlist file types,⍞000D    upper case letters ''MOW4''  for different music file types and⍞000D    upper case letters ''DFPS''  for extra switches.⍞000D⍞000DThe following file types may be created:⍞000D⍞000D    a → .asx file (Media Player should detect this),⍞000D    b → .b4s file (WinAmp''s XML format, not supported by the version 5.*),⍞000D    m → .m3u file (the old WinAmp playlist, this is the default),⍞000D    p → .pls file (WinAmp),⍞000D    w → .wpl file (Media Player).⍞000D⍞000DSeveral  files  may be created in one run.  The playlist file is created only if⍞000Dcorresponding  music  files  are  present in the directory. By default, the file⍞000Dlist  doesn''t  contain  the  path (i.e. the file "d:\mp3\Album\song.mp3" will be⍞000Dshown in the list only as "song.mp3").⍞000D⍞000DThe switches are:⍞000D⍞000D    D → Delete the playlists (from directories specified in the right argument),⍞000D    F → make the Folder name as the playlist name (instead of the default play-⍞000D        list.extension)⍞000D    P → use the full file Path name in the list,⍞000D    S → do not visit the Sub-directories.⍞000D⍞000DThe shy result has all the created playlist names.⍞000D⍞000DFor example,⍞000D⍞000DTo create new m3u and wpl playlists for all the mp3 albums found in d:\mp3,⍞000DC:\My Music and their sub-directories:⍞000D⍞000D  ''mw'' mp3 ''d:\mp3'' ''C:\My Music''⍞000D⍞000DTo delete all asx and b4s playlists found in d:\mp3 and its children:⍞000D⍞000D  ''abD'' mp3 ''d:\mp3''⍞000D⍞000DThe function uses ⎕NA for directory reading.⍞000D⍞000DN.B.  I cannot guarantee that the playlist files will work in every machine con-⍞000Dfiguration   -  I  have just sort of reverse engineered the minimum file formats⍞000Dthat seem to work adequately in my machines.⍞000D⍞000DExamples:⍞000D⍞000D        mp3 ''d:\mp3''  ⍝ create m3u playlist files (if there are any mp3 files)⍞000D                      ⍝ in the directory d:\mp3 and its sub-directories.⍞000D⍞000D        mp3 ''d:'' ''c:'' ⍝ create m3u files in every C: and D: directory where⍞000D                      ⍝ there are mp3 files..⍞000D⍞000D  ''apw'' mp3 ''d:\mp3''  ⍝ create the asx, pls and wpl playlist files.⍞000D⍞000D ''apwO'' mp3 ''d:\mp3''  ⍝ as the previous example, but create only for .ogg files.⍞000D⍞000D''apwOP'' mp3 ''d:\mp3''  ⍝ ditto, now the file lists contain paths.⍞000D⍞000D ''apwD'' mp3 ''d:\mp3''  ⍝ delete all asx, pls and wpl playlists.⍞000D⍞000D''apwDS'' mp3 ''d:\mp3''  ⍝ ditto, but only from the d:\mp3 directory.⍞000D⍞000DIndex:MP3 (media player)|playlist|music|media player (MP3)|diversions⍞000DIndex;Jantunen V-M.'
