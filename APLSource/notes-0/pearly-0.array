'On Arriving at the Pearly Gates⍞000D-------------------------------⍞000DOn  arriving  at the Pearly Gates, if you have been thinking and coding in a de-⍞000Dclarative style, be sure to mention this to an official, who will fast-track you⍞000Dthrough.⍞000D⍞000DIn  days-gone-by,  this would have made little difference.  The old wrought-iron⍞000DGates were at the end of a winding path; atop a grassy hill; betwixt high, white⍞000Dwalls; ''neath a clear, blue sky.  You would just chip up; press  the  bell;  and⍞000Dwait for Saint Peter to show you in.⍞000D⍞000DHowever, with the steady year-on-year increase in traffic, the Gate Area now re-⍞000Dsembles the  immigration  hall  at  JFK;  the lines zig-zag out of sight and you⍞000Dcan''t quite hear the announcements. You''ll be glad of any little advantage.⍞000D⍞000D(⍞000D    One test They use  is to see whether your end-of-line comments are predomin-⍞000D    antly noun-phrases, rather than imperatives.⍞000D⍞000D        ⌽⍺      ⍝ reverse ⍺         (imperative indicates procedural thinking)⍞000D        ⌽⍵      ⍝ the reverse of ⍵  (noun phrase suggests declarative thinking)⍞000D                  ¯¯¯         ¯¯⍞000D        n←+/v   ⍝ add up v and assign it to n       (procedural)⍞000D        n←+/v   ⍝ n is the sum of the items of v    (declarative)⍞000D                    ¯¯     ¯¯¯⍞000D    Of course, you could rip through and edit your comments  but They have other⍞000D    ways ...⍞000D⍞000D    They might ask you to read "m←0" aloud:⍞000D⍞000D        "m gets zero"               (procedural)⍞000D        "m becomes zero"            (procedural)⍞000D        "zero m"                    (procedural)⍞000D⍞000D        "m is zero"                 (declarative)⍞000D        "m names zero"              (declarative)⍞000D        "m indicates zero"          (declarative)⍞000D        "m is specified as zero"    (declarative - KEI)⍞000D        "m denotes zero"            (declarative - SJT)⍞000D⍞000D    They might ask what happens when the interpreter evaluates m←0:⍞000D⍞000D        "It assigns the value zero to m"            (procedural)⍞000D        "It assigns the name m to zero"             (declarative)⍞000D⍞000D    For a declarative view of the world, it may be helpful to visualise "←" as a⍞000D    right-pointing finger, rather than as a left-pointing arrow (in the same way⍞000D    that ⊢ is a right-pointing tack).⍞000D⍞000D    Regarding assignment: at a baby-naming ceremony we (with  the  possible  ex-⍞000D    ception of some folk in the pop music  industry)  usually think of assigning⍞000D    the name to the baby, rather than the baby to the name.⍞000D⍞000D    And finally:⍞000D⍞000D        "APL evaluates right-to-left"                           (procedural)⍞000D        "APL functions apply to everything to their right"      (declarative)⍞000D⍞000D        12÷1+2  ⍝ two added to one then divided into twelve     (procedural)⍞000D        12÷1+2  ⍝ twelve divided by: one plus two               (declarative)⍞000D⍞000D    and for a pop at a place at Top Table, you might suggest that J←2+I be verb-⍞000D    alised:⍞000D⍞000D        J←2+I   ⍝ J denotes the second successor of the referent of I⍞000D⍞000D    See: http://dfns.dyalog.com/downloads/howcomp.pdf⍞000D)⍞000D⍞000DSee also: declarative⍞000D⍞000DIndex:Gates, Pearly|Heaven|declarative programming|JFK Airport⍞000DIndex;Iverson K.E.|Taylor S.J.'
