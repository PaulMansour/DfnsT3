Two correlations seem to be favoured:⍞000D⍞000DThe first, known as "GMT"  (Goodman, Martinez, Thompson),  suggests  that  Mayan⍞000Ddate 0.0.0.0.0 corresponds to  Julian date 584,283.  This is based on studies of⍞000Dsome  contemporary  Central American communities, whose calendar seems to be in-⍞000Dherited from the Maya.  The  argument  is  that  (unless  the population of such⍞000Dpeoples dwindled to a critical number at some point in the past before  recover-⍞000Ding) it is inconceivable that their calendar should have missed or gained  days;⍞000Dit would be as unthinkable as western civilisation''s  missing  or  duplicating a⍞000Dcouple of Wednesdays.⍞000D⍞000DThe second "GMT+2", which uses relatively recent evidence, is  based  upon Mayan⍞000Drecorded observations  of  eclipses.  We  can  date  such  events  with  extreme⍞000Daccuracy, and they suggest a correlation with Julian date 584,285.⍞000D⍞000DIf the astronomical recording was accurate, an explanation  of  the  discrepency⍞000Dmight be that the 584,285 calendar was subsequently adjusted to realign with the⍞000Dseasons in the same way the Gregorian calendar skipped 3-13 September in 1752.⍞000D⍞000DThe functions shown here use the 584,283 (GMT) correlation, which now appears to⍞000Dbe the more generally accepted one.⍞000D⍞000DCycles⍞000D------⍞000DToday  almost  all of the civilised world enjoys a 7-day week. This cycle, which⍞000Dis  independent of month and year, is so universal that we forget why we decided⍞000Dupon seven.⍞000D⍞000D(muse:⍞000D⍞000D    There are many suggestions as to the origin of the 7-day week, and no single⍞000D    theory is widely accepted as the definitive answer.⍞000D⍞000D    One  example is that the concept of the week arose in primitive agricultural⍞000D    societies,  where  seven  days  was about the right interval for a farmer to⍞000D    prepare  and  bring  his goods to market. A shorter interval would waste too⍞000D    much  time away from production, and a longer one might risk goods perishing⍞000D    between market days.⍞000D⍞000D    Note  firstly, that there are strong reasons for market days to occur at ex-⍞000D    actly  regular  intervals:  every so-many days, rather than being constantly⍞000D    re-negotiated.  With a regular "week", there is much more chance of everyone⍞000D    showing up on the same day; a prerequisite for successful trading.⍞000D⍞000D    It  is tempting to speculate whether widespread acceptance of an interval of⍞000D    seven days might have come about by a form of natural selection, rather than⍞000D    as  a collective or bureaucratic conscious decision: A farmer returning from⍞000D    his  local  market might have found on occasion, that his figs, chickens and⍞000D    so-forth  were  ready again after six days. If his local market did not fall⍞000D    on  the  following  day,  he might have felt inclined to take his goods to a⍞000D    neighbouring village''s market even though it was slightly farther to travel.⍞000D⍞000D    Villages whose market days just happened to accommodate natural agricultural⍞000D    cycles  would  tend to retain regular trade as well as to attract occasional⍞000D    additional  visitors,  whereas  those with slightly more inconvenient cycles⍞000D    would tend to decline. In this way, farmer-friendly market cycles would tend⍞000D    automatically to become the norm.⍞000D⍞000D    (⍞000D        Having  established  same-length  cycles in adjacent villages, there may⍞000D        have  been  a  second mechanism that selected for staggered market days,⍞000D        while reinforcing their regularity.⍞000D⍞000D        Service  providers  such as pot-menders and tooth-pullers, who needed no⍞000D        time  to prepare between market days, would probably have toured markets⍞000D        on  different  days in nearby locations. In the case of a collision, the⍞000D        trader  would  probably  have chosen the better-attended market, and his⍞000D        presence  there  would in turn have made that market marginally more at-⍞000D        tractive to shoppers, tending to increase its size, ... and so on.⍞000D⍞000D        Looking  at  the  larger picture, these rotating service providers (axe-⍞000D        grinders,  sooth-sayers,  hair-cutters, entertainers, ...) could be seen⍞000D        as  the teeth on the interlocking cogs of an expanding economic machine,⍞000D        which  absorbed  adjacent communities, synchronising them into the 7-day⍞000D        cycle.⍞000D⍞000D        (⍞000D            If  this were the case, we might expect the names of the days of the⍞000D            week  (in a particular locale) to indicate the locations of the more⍞000D            important  markets in that area: "Oxford-day", "Banbury-day", and so⍞000D            forth, rather than being named after deities.⍞000D        )⍞000D    )⍞000D⍞000D    That  the Mayan civilization chose a week with thirteen days (see below), as⍞000D    opposed to one with seven, does not, of itself, detract from this theory, as⍞000D    the  Mayan  agricultural  profile was quite different from that of Eurasia''s⍞000D    "Fertile Crescent".  See "Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societ-⍞000D    ies", Jared Diamond.⍞000D⍞000D    But all of this is merely conjecture ...⍞000D)⍞000D⍞000DThe  Mayan calendar included several cycles, two of which often accompany a Long⍞000DCount date.
