'cmat ← {attributes} ##.attrib namelist      ⍝ Function/operator attributes.⍞000D⍞000DThe right argument is a namelist of functions or operators and the optional left⍞000Dargument,  a  character  vector  of  the attributes to be displayed. By default,⍞000Ddate,  name  and first comment are shown in date-time order. The attributes that⍞000Dcan be displayed are:⍞000D⍞000D    n   name of function or operator,⍞000D    d   date of fix yyyy-mm-dd,⍞000D    t   time of fix   hh:mm:ss,⍞000D    i   id of fixer,⍞000D    r   number of rows,⍞000D    c   number of cols,⍞000D    s   size or "workspace footprint" in bytes.⍞000D    ∇   function or operator syntax which is depicted:⍞000D⍞000D        ⍴←     explicit result.⍞000D        {⍴←}   shy result.⍞000D        ⍺      required left argument.⍞000D        {⍺}    optional left argument.⍞000D        ⍺⍺     left operand.⍞000D        ⍵      right argument.⍞000D        ⍵⍵     right operand.⍞000D        ∇      function.⍞000D        ∇∇     operator.⍞000D⍞000D    ⍝   first line comment,⍞000D⍞000DIn addition, sort characters ''⍋'' and ''∧'' are acknowledged:⍞000D⍞000D    ⍋   use following row as a  _visible_   sort field.⍞000D    ∧   use following row as an _invisible_ sort field.⍞000D⍞000D    ·    any other character is passed literally to the result column.⍞000D⍞000D[attrib]  is  a good candidate for invocation using a programmable function (PF)⍞000Dkey, see →PF_keys←.⍞000D⍞000DTechnical notes:⍞000D⍞000DAPL''s  traditional  "name clash" problem is avoided by executing the name refer-⍞000Dencing  system functions: ⎕AT, ⎕NR, ⎕SIZE, chronologically _before_ the creation⍞000Dof any of attrib''s local names. This means that at system function time, none of⍞000Dthe subject names are obscured by local definitions.⍞000D⍞000D    ···⍞000D    names lines sntx time ids sizes←↑{  ⍝ names local to attrib.⍞000D        (⊂↓⍵){⍺,⍵                       ⍝   names,⍞000D        }(⊂⎕NR¨↓⍵){⍺,⍵                  ⍝   ⎕NR,⍞000D        }(1 1 0 1/↓⍉↑,↓⎕AT ⍵){⍺,⍵       ⍝   ⎕AT,⍞000D        }⊂⎕SIZE ⍵                       ⍝   ⎕SIZE.⍞000D    }⎕FMT↑⍵                             ⍝ executed _before_ local name creation.⍞000D    ···⍞000D⍞000DNotice  that  a more readable and seemingly equivalent version of the inner four⍞000Dlines above:⍞000D⍞000D        names←⊂↓⍵                       ⍝ fn/op names.⍞000D        lines←⊂⎕NR¨↓⍵                   ⍝ ⎕NR,⍞000D        attrs←1 1 0 1/↓⍉↑,↓⎕AT ⍵        ⍝ ⎕AT,⍞000D        sizes←⊂⎕SIZE ⍵                  ⍝ ⎕SIZE,⍞000D        names,lines,attrs,sizes         ⍝ accumulated attributes.⍞000D⍞000D...  would defeat the object by creating "early" local names. For example, local⍞000Dnames: [names], [lines] and [attrs], would obscure a workspace function or oper-⍞000Dator  of  the  same name from the following system functions. An alternative but⍞000Dungainly coding would be to string the whole thing across a single source line:⍞000D⍞000D        (⊂↓⍵),(⊂⎕NR¨↓⍵),(1 1 0 1/↓⍉↑,↓⎕AT ⍵),⊂⎕SIZE ⍵⍞000D⍞000D...  but  this  is  over-long and hard to comment or amend. The compromise is to⍞000Dspread it over several lines using the linking function: {⍺,⍵}⍞000D⍞000D         (···){⍺,⍵⍞000D        }(···){⍺,⍵⍞000D        }(···)⍞000D⍞000DIncidentally,  "workspace footprint"  is  perhaps a less misleading term for the⍞000Dresult of ⎕SIZE. If we imagine the footprints from a number of people on a dusty⍞000Dfloor,  some of the prints will probably overlap and in extremis, the total area⍞000Dof  individual  footprints  might exceed that of the floor. Similarly, the ⎕SIZE⍞000Dreported  for each function or operator includes that of the symbols and literal⍞000Dconstants  it  references.  As  symbols  and constants with identical values are⍞000Dshared (or overlap) between functions and operators, (+/⎕SIZE ⎕NL 3 4) could ex-⍞000Dceed the value of ⎕WA in an empty workspace!⍞000D⍞000DExamples:⍞000D⍞000D      attrib ''a''⎕nl 3                       ⍝ a-functions in date-time order.⍞000D2000-10-01  ascfile  ⍝ Ascii file as nested vector.⍞000D2000-11-09  ambiv    ⍝ Ambivalize traditional functions.⍞000D2001-11-02  assign   ⍝ Hungarian method cost assignment.⍞000D2002-10-31  attrib   ⍝ Function/operator attributes.⍞000D⍞000D      names←''attrib'' ''wsdiff'' ''pow'' ''else''  ⍝ selection of fns/ops.⍞000D⍞000D      attrib names                          ⍝ default fields in fixtime order.⍞000D1998-03-05  else    ⍝ Condition f else g ...⍞000D2000-10-11  pow     ⍝ Explicit function power.⍞000D2002-10-31  wsdiff  ⍝ Workspace differences.⍞000D2002-10-31  attrib  ⍝ Function/operator attributes.⍞000D⍞000D      ''n ⍝''attrib names                     ⍝ names and comments.⍞000Dattrib ⍝ Function/operator attributes.⍞000Dwsdiff ⍝ Workspace differences.⍞000Dpow    ⍝ Explicit function power.⍞000Delse   ⍝ Condition f else g ...⍞000D⍞000D      ''⍋n ⍝''attrib names                    ⍝ names and comments in name order.⍞000Dattrib ⍝ Function/operator attributes.⍞000Delse   ⍝ Condition f else g ...⍞000Dpow    ⍝ Explicit function power.⍞000Dwsdiff ⍝ Workspace differences.⍞000D⍞000D      ''n i r×c ∇ ⍝''attrib names             ⍝ name id rows cols syntax comment.⍞000Dattrib Dyadic  56×82 ⍴←{⍺}∇⍵        ⍝ Function/operator attributes.⍞000Dwsdiff Dyadic 102×82 ⍴←{⍺}∇⍵        ⍝ Workspace differences.⍞000Dpow    Dyadic   3×50 ⍴←{⍺}(⍺⍺∇∇)⍵   ⍝ Explicit function power.⍞000Delse   Dyadic   4×45 ⍴←{⍺}(⍺⍺∇∇⍵⍵)⍵ ⍝ Condition f else g ...⍞000D⍞000D      ''dTt s''attrib names                   ⍝ ISO timestamp and size.⍞000D2002-10-31T14:19:22 5340⍞000D2002-10-31T10:42:03 8528⍞000D2000-10-11T12:14:54  360⍞000D1998-03-05T16:41:54  436⍞000D⍞000D      ''n ⍋s''attrib names                    ⍝ names in order of WS footprint.⍞000Dpow     360⍞000Delse    436⍞000Dattrib 5340⍞000Dwsdiff 8528⍞000D⍞000D      ''n ⍋r×⍋c''attrib names                 ⍝ names in row, then col order.⍞000Dpow      3×50⍞000Delse     4×45⍞000Dattrib  56×82⍞000Dwsdiff 102×82⍞000D⍞000D⍝ The final examples show the difference in sorting on date or date-time.⍞000D⍞000D      ''⍋d ⍋t n''attrib 2↑names               ⍝ date-time order⍞000D2002-10-31 10:42:03 wsdiff⍞000D2002-10-31 14:19:22 attrib⍞000D⍞000D      ''⍋d n''attrib 2↑names                  ⍝ date order.⍞000D2002-10-31 attrib⍞000D2002-10-31 wsdiff⍞000D⍞000D      ''⍋d∧t n''attrib 2↑names                ⍝ date-(time) order.⍞000D2002-10-31 wsdiff⍞000D2002-10-31 attrib⍞000D⍞000DSee also: PF_keys⍞000D⍞000DIndex:attributes|⎕AT|⎕SIZE|syntax|name-clash problem'
