'cmp ← {cmp←1} ##.packT exp                  ⍝ Simple text vector packager.⍞000D⍞000D[packT] is a simple text vector packager, proposed by Stefano Lanzavecchia.⍞000D⍞000DThe repeated items are replaced with [esc][asc][chr], where:⍞000D⍞000D    esc = "escape" character (⎕AV[1 2 or 3], it shouldn''t be in the data!)⍞000D    asc = ⎕AV character indicates how many times the char must be repeated⍞000D    chr = the character⍞000D⍞000DBecause  the  RLE  coding takes three characters, short repeated strings are not⍞000Dpacked  (and  thus  ⎕AV[1 2 3]  are  free  for "esc"); if the repeated areas are⍞000Dlonger  than  256  chars,  there  will be more esc sequences. If there are "esc"⍞000Dcharacters,  they  are doubled. This is a nice algorithm, but I (VMJ) have found⍞000Dno real world data where it would be useful.⍞000D⍞000DSee also: Data_compression⍞000D⍞000DIndex:packing|compression⍞000DIndex;Lanzavecchia S.|Jantunen V-M.'
