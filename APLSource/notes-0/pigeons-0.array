'Folklore has it that: "Nobody ever saw a baby pigeon."⍞000D⍞000DIt turns out that adult pigeons come into existence spontaneously, often in mid-⍞000Dair,  sometimes  at  high  altitude, with a flurry of feathers and a loud THWOPP⍞000Dsound, reminiscent of one of those cardboard and brown paper kite-shaped thwopp-⍞000Ders, occasionally free with the Beano.⍞000D⍞000DSome commentators think that the pigeon is surprised by the event but philosoph-⍞000Ders  argue  that this is not so: surprise is the experience of the sudden change⍞000Dfrom one subjective state to another and in this case there is no prior state.⍞000D⍞000DIndex:pigeons|Beano|squab'
