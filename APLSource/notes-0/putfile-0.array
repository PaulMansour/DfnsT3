'{size} ← {term←2} ##.putfile (fid rows)     ⍝ Put rows to text-file.⍞000D⍞000DWrites  [rows] to text file [fid]. Optional left argument (default 2) determines⍞000Dhow many terminator characters are to be appended to each line:⍞000D⍞000D    2:  cr lf   (Windows)⍞000D    1:  lf      (Unix)⍞000D    0:          (no line terminators)⍞000D⍞000DIf the file already exists, its contents are _replaced_.⍞000D⍞000DThe shy result is the [size] of the file in bytes.⍞000D⍞000DTechnical note:⍞000D⍞000DIn preparation for the Unicode version of Dyalog, the file is assumed to contain⍞000Dany  and  only  characters from ⎕AV. This means that pre-Unicode versions should⍞000Duse  conversion  code  82 and post-Unicode should use 160. This is achieved with⍞000Dversion-independent code:⍞000D⍞000D    size←cvec ⎕NAPPEND ntie,⎕DR ⎕AV     ⍝ write lines to file.⍞000D                            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯⍞000DExamples:⍞000D⍞000D      lines←''first line'' ''second'' ''third''⍞000D⍞000D      putfile ''tmp.txt'' lines       ⍝ create (Windows) text file.⍞000D⍞000DSee also: getfile xtabs⍞000D⍞000DIndex:native file|text file|Unicode'
